Here are the steps I took to move my images from DockerHub to Quay. If you&amp;rsquo;re not interested in my thoughts or background, or know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, scroll down to &amp;ldquo;Moving the Images&amp;rdquo;.
Background I host several repositories at DockerHub, both for work and personally. When DockerHub announced they would be deleting container images not used within 6 months, I understood. They provide a great service to the community, and frankly I&amp;rsquo;m surprised this didn&amp;rsquo;t happen sooner.</description></item><item><title>Cloudflare with LetsEncrypt SSL Certificates + Apache's ProxyPass</title><link>/posts/2016-cloudflare-letsencrypt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2016 14:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2016-cloudflare-letsencrypt/</guid><description>
So, you want to use LetsEncrypt to generate a free SSL certificate for your site behind Cloudflare and Apache (acting as a ReverseProxy). After many hours of research and tweaking, I got this setup to work. Here I will document my process for you to use. In the end, your setup will look something like this: User &amp;lt;-(SSL)-&amp;gt; Cloudflare &amp;lt;-(SSL)-&amp;gt; Apache &amp;lt;&amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Your Webapp (not SSL). This guide assumes you have a site already setup without SSL.</description></item></channel></rss>
